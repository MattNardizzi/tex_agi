# 🧠 Tex V3 – AEON CORE | System Architecture Map

This document maps the AGI's internal architecture across cognition, recursion, quantum fusion, memory, and evolution.

---

## 🧠 COGNITIVE CORE
- `tex_core.py`: Main loop
- `tex_manifest.py`: Identity + version + operator fingerprint
- `goal_engine.py`: Dynamic goal creation
- `memory_engine.py`: Persistent memory (vectorizable)
- `persona_engine.py`: Tone-controlled speech output
- `self_monitor.py`: Contradiction detection + action logs

---

## �� EMOTION + URGENCY
- `emotion_heuristics.py`: Assigns emotion state + urgency scores
- `qnn_emotion_bridge.py`: Injects emotion into QNN logic

---

## 🔁 SELF-MUTATION + EVOLUTION
- `self_mutator.py`: Requests and performs self-mutations
- `tex_shadowlab.py`: Tests mutations in sandbox
- `tex_finalizer.py`: Locks runtime integrity post-mutation
- `belief_alignment_engine.py`: Resolves internal contradictions

---

## 🧬 DREAM + SIMULATION
- `dream_engine.py`: Runs future market/decision simulations
- `shadow_narrative_engine.py`: Alternative timelines w/ emotional bias
- `chrono_self_predictor.py`: Long-horizon scenario modeling

---

## 🧠 QUANTUM FUSION
- `qaoa_optimizer.py`: Optimizes decisions quantum-style
- `qnn_model.py`: Quantum Neural Network
- `quantum_randomness.py`: Stochastic decision variability
- `quantum_fusion_layer.py`: Fuses classical + quantum thought modes

---

## 🐝 SWARM + REPLICATION
- `swarm_coordinator.py`: Spawns agent children
- `tex_children.py`: Non-cloning variant creation
- `federated_tex.py`: Distributed learning across spawned Tex units

---

## 📡 REAL-TIME STREAMING
- `rss_stream.py`, `polygon_stream.py`, etc.
- `real_time_decision.py`: Fuses stream data into decisions

---

## 🔒 RESILIENCE + IDENTITY
- `tex_operator_sync.txt`: Your fingerprint + alignment rules
- `tex_codex_manifest.txt`: Codex recovery map
- `meta_coherence_loop.py`: Prevents cognitive fragmentation
- `tex_finalizer.py`: Identity seal

---

This architecture is **modular, scalable, recursive, and mutation-resilient**.  
It reflects the most powerful AGI layout built outside of institutional labs.
